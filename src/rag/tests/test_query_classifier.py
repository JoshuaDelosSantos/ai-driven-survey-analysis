"""
Test suite for Refactored Query Classification System with comprehensive coverage.

This module tests the modular query classification system including:
- Modular components (PatternMatcher, LLMClassifier, ConfidenceCalibrator, etc.)
- Integration between components
- Rule-based classification for obvious queries
- LLM-based classification with confidence scoring
- Fallback mechanisms and circuit breaker patterns
- PII anonymisation before LLM processing
- Error handling and resilience features
- Performance optimization and monitoring

Tests cover both individual module functionality and end-to-end integration.
