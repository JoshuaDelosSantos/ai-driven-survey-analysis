Conversational Handler Module

This module implements intelligent conversational handling for the RAG system,
enabling natural interactions with greetings, system questions, and general
conversation alongside data analysis capabilities.

The conversational handler uses pattern recognition, Australian context, and
simple pattern learning to provide friendly, professional responses while
maintaining focus on the system's data analysis capabilities.
