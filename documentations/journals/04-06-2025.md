**Focus:** Sentiment Analysis Module Tests

## Today's Developments and Challenges

The primary focus today was fixing the evaluation mock data. The `did_experience_issue_detail` column was inconsistent with the semantic tone and context of the `did_experience_issue` column. I also worked on creating tests for the sentiment analysis module.

Key activities and accomplishments for today include:

- **Mock evaluation data**: LLMs (Gemini and OpenAI) could not resolve the issue described above. Gemini struggled to generate new data, while OpenAI had trouble implementing the changes. This may be due to the complexity and ambiguity of the task, possibly caused by poor prompt engineering. Ultimately, I manually refactored the evaluation data.
- **Tests**: Generated tests for the sentiment analysis module with the help of Claude 4 Sonnet.
    - Installed pytest
    - Created pytest.ini for the sentiment analysis module
    - Updated documentation
- **Notes**: Testing is time-consuming. I am considering skipping some tests for the MVP to focus on core functionality first.
