#### 3. Advanced Metadata Filtering Architecture:
- **Multi-Dimensional Filtering**: Simultaneous filtering across user hierarchy, organisational structure, content sentiment, and delivery methods
- **Hierarchical User Filtering**: Support for Australian Public Service level filtering (Level 1-6, Executive Levels, SES)
- **Agency-Specific Search**: Targeted search within specific government departments with proper organisational boundaries
- **Sentiment Analysis Integration**: Real-time sentiment-based filtering using transformer model outputs with configurable thresholds

#### 4. Performance & Scalability Design:
- **Async-First Architecture**: Non-blocking operations designed for high-concurrency agent environments
- **Efficient Vector Operations**: Optimised similarity search using pgVector's cosine similarity with ivfflat indexing
- **Metadata Query Optimisation**: GIN indexing on JSONB metadata fields for complex filter combinations
- **Connection Pool Management**: Efficient database resource utilisation with proper connection lifecycle management

### Enhanced Capabilities & Governance:

#### Vector Search Features:
```python
# Basic semantic search with privacy protection
response = await tool.search(
    query="feedback about technical difficulties",  # Auto-anonymised
    max_results=10,
    similarity_threshold=0.75
)

# Advanced metadata filtering with governance controls
response = await tool.search(
    query="senior staff feedback on virtual learning",
    filters={
        "user_level": ["Level 5", "Level 6", "Exec Level 1"],
        "agency": "Department of Finance",
        "sentiment": {"type": "negative", "min_score": 0.6}
    }
)
```

#### Privacy-Protected Results:
- **Anonymised Content**: All returned text chunks verified PII-free through anonymisation pipeline
- **Contextual Metadata**: Rich user and course context without exposing personal identifiers
