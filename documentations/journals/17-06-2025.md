- **Batch Processing**: Async batch embedding generation with configurable batch sizes for API efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with structured logging and graceful degradation strategies

#### 3. Australian Data Governance Integration:
- **Privacy-First Design**: All embedding operations designed to work with pre-anonymised text (PII detection from Task 2.1)
- **Metadata Security**: JSONB metadata fields support rich context storage without exposing personal identifiers
- **Model Versioning**: Explicit embedding model versioning for audit trail and future model migration capabilities
- **Data Retention**: Schema designed to support data lifecycle management with proper referential integrity

#### 4. Configuration Enhancement & Security:

- **Dimension Flexibility**: Configurable vector dimensions to support various embedding models (1536 for OpenAI, 384 for MiniLM)
- **Environment Integration**: Seamless integration with existing .env configuration management for deployment flexibility

#### 5. Dependencies & Documentation:
- **Requirements Management**: Added sentence-transformers==3.3.1 for local embedding capabilities reducing API dependencies
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created detailed README with usage examples, security considerations, and Australian compliance notes
- **Database Documentation**: Enhanced database module documentation to include vector infrastructure components

### Technical Architecture & Security:

#### 1. Vector Storage Security:

- **Write Isolation**: Embedding ingestion uses separate connection context with proper transaction management
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of embedding operations with metadata tracking and performance metrics
- **Foreign Key Integrity**: Cascade deletion ensures data consistency when evaluation records are removed

#### 2. Multi-Provider Architecture:
- **Provider Abstraction**: Clean separation between embedding logic and provider implementation for security audit
- **Local Fallback**: Sentence Transformers provider reduces external API dependencies for sensitive operations
- **API Security**: Separate embedding API key support for credential isolation and least-privilege access
- **Model Validation**: Runtime validation of embedding dimensions against database schema configuration

#### 3. Performance & Scalability Design:
- **Async-First Architecture**: All database and embedding operations non-blocking for future LangGraph integration
- **Batch Optimisation**: Configurable batch sizes (default 100) for balancing API efficiency and memory usage
- **Index Strategy**: Optimised vector similarity search with ivfflat indexing and metadata filtering capabilities
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling with proper resource cleanup and timeout handling

#### 4. Data Governance Controls:
- **Anonymised Storage**: Designed to store only PII-anonymised text chunks ensuring Australian privacy compliance
- **Metadata Governance**: Rich metadata storage supports analytics while maintaining data sovereignty principles
- **Version Control**: Embedding model versioning enables audit trail and migration path for model upgrades
- **Retention Framework**: Schema supports future data retention policies with proper cascade relationships

### Database Schema & Governance:

#### Vector Embeddings Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE rag_embeddings (
    embedding_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    response_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES evaluation(response_id),
    field_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     -- Target fields: general_feedback, did_experience_issue_detail, course_application_other
    chunk_text TEXT NOT NULL,            -- PII-anonymised text chunk
    chunk_index INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- Chunk position for reconstruction
    embedding VECTOR(1536) NOT NULL,     -- Configurable dimension
    model_version VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Audit trail for model changes
    metadata JSONB,                      -- Rich context without personal identifiers
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(response_id, field_name, chunk_index)
);
```

#### Security & Performance Indexes:
- **Vector Similarity**: `ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)` for efficient semantic search
- **Metadata Filtering**: `GIN (metadata)` for complex JSONB query performance
- **Foreign Key Optimisation**: Standard B-tree indexes for response_id and field_name joins
