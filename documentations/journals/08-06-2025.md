**Focus:** Research for RAG module

## Deep research on how a RAG module would fit in the current project
- Existing Setup: The project uses a Docker-based environment with a PostgreSQL database containing 'user', 'learning_content', 'evaluations', and 'attendance' tables. pgvector is used for storing vector embeddings.
- Relational RAG: This technique enhances LLMs by providing them with access to structured data from relational databases, improving response accuracy and enabling natural language queries. Text-to-SQL is a core mechanism for translating natural language queries into SQL queries.
- Embedding Relational Data: Strategies for transforming relational data into embeddings include row serialization, textual descriptions of relationships, embedding table schemas (DDL), column descriptions, and Question-SQL pairs. Embedding models like Sentence-BERT or those from cloud AI services can be used.

### Tools and Frameworks:
- LangChain and LlamaIndex are LLM orchestration frameworks suitable for relational RAG. LangChain excels in building agents for complex Text-to-SQL, while LlamaIndex focuses on data indexing and retrieval and hybrid queries (SQL + Vector).
- SQLAlchemy acts as the link between LLM orchestration frameworks and the PostgreSQL database.
- NLTK/spaCy can be used for query pre-processing and data preparation for embedding.
- Apache Airflow or Prefect can be used for workflow orchestration of data pipelines.
- Scikit-learn can be used for calculating RAG metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- FastAPI is recommended for building an API to expose the RAG system.

### Architectural Blueprints:
- Architecture 1: Agentic Text-to-SQL for complex queries.
- Architecture 2: Hybrid approach combining Text-to-SQL with semantic search over serialized data.
- Architecture 3: Simplified Text-to-SQL with context augmentation from pre-defined views/summaries.
- LLM Deployment: Cloud-based APIs vs. local models: Cloud APIs offer scalability and performance, while local models provide greater data privacy and control.
- Data Privacy and Governance: Compliance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) is essential. Data minimization, anonymization, and pseudonymization techniques should be used. Enforce least privilege access in the database and validate code (especially LLM-generated SQL) before execution.
- Strategic Recommendations: A phased implementation approach is suggested, starting with a core Text-to-SQL RAG and prototyping, then moving to enhancement, security, and privacy hardening, and finally scaling, optimization, and advanced features.

### Comparing Architectures:
#### Architecture 1: 
Agentic Text-to-SQL for Complex Querying focuses on maximizing accuracy for complex queries that require precise SQL generation. This architecture utilizes a multi-step agentic workflow with LangChain, involving query understanding, schema retrieval, SQL generation, validation, and execution. It stores embeddings of table DDL statements, column descriptions, and example Question-SQL pairs in pgvector. While it offers the potential for the highest accuracy on complex SQL queries and aids transparency and debugging, it is the most complex to implement and maintain, with higher latency and cost due to multiple LLM calls.

#### Architecture 2: 
Hybrid Approach ‚Äì SQL Execution with Semantic Search over Serialised Data aims to provide flexibility for diverse queries that may need structured SQL data, semantic search over textual content, or a combination of both. This approach intelligently routes queries using LangChain or LlamaIndex's SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine to decide between SQL execution, semantic search, or a hybrid path. Along with the data from Architecture 1, it also embeds serialized rows or meaningful textual chunks from tables. This method is highly flexible for diverse query types and directly leverages free-text fields for semantic search, but the router logic can be challenging to perfect, and deciding what and how to serialize and embed row data can impact storage and computation.

#### Architecture 3: 
Simplified Text-to-SQL with Contextual Augmentation from Pre-defined Views/Summaries offers a simpler Text-to-SQL implementation, enhanced with pre-computed textual summaries derived from the database. This architecture primarily focuses on Text-to-SQL generation with a separate semantic retrieval step for pre-defined summaries. It embeds table DDL statements, column descriptions, and pre-generated summaries in pgvector. While it provides a simpler initial implementation and rich, curated context for common questions, it is less flexible for ad-hoc semantic queries on raw row content and its utility depends heavily on the quality and maintenance of the pre-generated summaries.


## Blog - [RAG is more than just a vector search](https://www.timescale.com/blog/rag-is-more-than-just-vector-search)
- Layered Approach: Modern AI applications require a layered approach to RAG, which goes beyond simple semantic searches over vector databases.
- Need for Multiple Capabilities: A good RAG system needs capabilities like time-based filtering, text search, and aggregations, which embedding search alone cannot provide.
- PostgreSQL and Timescale: PostgreSQL and Timescale offer a blend of vector search, time-series capabilities, and SQL flexibility in a single database.
- Structured Data Extraction: Language models can be used for structured data extraction.
- Evaluation-Driven Development: The importance of evaluation-driven development is emphasised.
- Implementation Example: The article demonstrates how to implement embedding search and text-to-SQL using Timescale for a GitHub issues Q+A application.
