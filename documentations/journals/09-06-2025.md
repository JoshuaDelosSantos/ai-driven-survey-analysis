# Journal Entry

**Focus:** RAG Blueprint

- Curated a detailed 'phase' [plan](../architecture.md) for the new RAG module.
- Consulted with Gemini 2.5 Pro about the blueprint.

## Gemini Consult:

### --Addendum--:
- Claude Sonnet 4 was used to curate a detailed prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro with the codebase in context.
- Specifically, a critical analysis on the architechtural approach.
- V2 of the architecutre was curated with the help of Gemini 2.5 Pro

### General Areas for Improvement and Closer Scrutiny:

#### Depth vs. Breadth in Early Phases:
- **Critique**: There's a potential risk that early phases might attempt to cover too much functional breadth rather than achieving depth in a narrow, end-to-end slice. The MVP phase, in particular, should be sharply focused on delivering a single, valuable piece of functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure Phase 1 (MVP) has a very tightly scoped objective, for instance, successfully answering a predefined type of question using only the Text-to-SQL path for a limited set of database tables, via the terminal.

#### Specificity of Tasks:
- **Critique**: Tasks within each phase need to be concrete, actionable, and technically specific. Generic tasks like "Develop RAG logic" are insufficient for guiding a development team.
- **Recommendation**: Refine tasks to be more granular, e.g., "Implement Text-to-SQL chain using LangChain's SQLDatabaseToolkit and QuerySQLCheckerTool for X specific tables."

#### Clarity of LangGraph Integration:
- **Critique**: The plan needs to be explicit about when and how LangGraph is introduced and utilised, especially for the crucial query routing component of Architecture 2. Its role is central and should be clearly defined from an early stage if it's the intended orchestration framework. [2 (II.D)5]
- **Recommendation**: If LangGraph is the target, introduce a minimal LangGraph setup even in the MVP phase (e.g., a simple graph to call the SQL tool). This establishes the pattern early.

#### Detail in Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:
- **Critique**: This critical area is often underestimated. The plan must provide more detail on:
    - The process for extracting, potentially embedding (for semantic schema search), and making DDL/schema information available to the Text-to-SQL LLM. [2 (IV.A.1)6]
    - The specific strategy for serializing free-text fields (e.g., from Learning Content Evaluation), performing PII anonymisation, embedding this data, and storing it in pgvector for the vector search component. [2 (IV.A.2, IV.B)7]
- **Recommendation**: Add dedicated sub-tasks in relevant phases for (a) schema preparation for Text-to-SQL and (b) ingestion pipeline development for unstructured/free-text data, including anonymisation.

#### Actionability of Data Privacy & Governance Measures:
- **Critique**: While the importance of data privacy and governance is acknowledged, the plan should move beyond listing principles to integrating specific, actionable steps into the development phases.
- **Recommendation**: For each phase, explicitly list data privacy tasks, e.g., "Phase 1: Create and configure dedicated read-only PostgreSQL user rag_user_readonly." "Phase 2: Implement PII anonymisation using Presidio for specified free-text columns during the data ingestion process." [2 (III.A, III.B)8]

#### Strategy for Testing and Validation:
- **Critique**: Generic statements like "Test functionality" are insufficient. A more defined testing strategy is needed.
- **Recommendation**: For each phase, outline the types of tests to be performed:
    - Unit tests for individual modules/functions (e.g., PII anonymisation logic, specific LangChain tools).
    - Integration tests for segments of the pipeline (e.g., Text-to-SQL chain from query to SQL execution).
    - End-to-end tests via the terminal application for MVP, and later for API endpoints. [2 (V.E)]

#### Decoupling for Future FastAPI Integration:
- **Critique**: The plan must ensure that the core RAG logic developed for the terminal MVP is genuinely decoupled from the interface.
- **Recommendation**: Emphasise that the core RAG agent (LangGraph) should have well-defined input/output contracts and contain no terminal-specific code, making the future FastAPI integration a matter of adding a new presentation layer. [2 (VII.A)]

## Implementation Progress: RAG Database Security Setup

**Completed Phase 1, Task 1.1** - Following Gemini's "Actionability of Data Privacy & Governance Measures" feedback.

### Key Deliverables:

#### 1. Database Security (`create_rag_readonly_role.py`):
- Created `rag_user_readonly` role with minimal SELECT-only privileges
- Explicitly denied write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CREATE)
- Implemented defence-in-depth security with APP compliance support

#### 2. Environment Setup:
- Added RAG database credentials to `.env`
- Configured dedicated read-only connection parameters

#### 3. Security Testing (`tests/test_rag_connection.py`):
- Automated validation of permissions and restrictions
- Verified SELECT access on required tables (50 users, 100 content, 200 attendance)
- Confirmed write operations are blocked
- Pytest integration with proper assertions

#### 4. Documentation (`db/README.md`):
- Added security section and usage examples
- Updated prerequisites and best practices

### Results:
Secure read-only database access established  
All security constraints validated through automated testing  
Foundation ready for RAG module development
