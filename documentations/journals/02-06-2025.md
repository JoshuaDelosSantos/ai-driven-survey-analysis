- 1.1 Vector Data: Numerical representations of various data types, capturing meaning  in high-dimensional space.
- 1.2 Vector Database: System for efficient storage and search of these vectors.
- 1.3 RAG: ChatGPT like apps with your data.
- 1.4 Text to SQL: Natural language quearies on structured data.
- 1.5 PG Vector: Provides vector data type, distance functions and vector search indexes (HNSW, IVF, FLAT).
- 1.6 PG Vector Scale: Speeds up PG Vector for large workloads, offers hihg-accuracy filtered search, and its own index (StreamingDiskANN).
- 1.7 PGAI: Brings AI workflows to PostgreSQL (embedding creation, in-database LLM reasoning).
- 1.8 IVFFlat: For medium workloads (100k-1M vectors). Loww memory, but required index re-builds in updates.
- 1.9 HNSW: For real-time search on medium workloads (up to 10M vectors). Good speed/accuracy, handles updates, but high memory usage and issues with filtered search accuracy.
- 1.10 StreamingDiskANN: For real-time, filtered search, and large-scale (+10M) workloads. High filtered search accuracy, scales to 1B+ vectors, leverages SSDs, but longer initial build times.

- 2.1 Nomic Embed Text: This is an embedding model supported by Ollama. Its performance is mentioned as being comparable to OpenAI's embedding models.
