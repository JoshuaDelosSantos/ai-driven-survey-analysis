# Focus: Exploratory Research
1. Advnaced RAG Privacy Research.
- 1.1 Data Transmission: When using web-based LLM APIs like OpenAI's, private data (document, chunks, databse schemas) are transmitted externally to the LLM provider for processing.
- 1.2 OpenAI Data Policies: Policy states that data sent via its API are not used for training by default. However, data is retained for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring. Zero Data Retention (ZDR) is available for eligible customers.
- 1.3 Security Measures: LLM providers implement security measures like TLS encryption for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest, and may have SOC 2 Type II compliance. Azure OpenAI offers a more isolated environment within the Azure ecosystem.
- 1.4 Risks: Using RAG with private data introduces risks like data leakage through retrieved contexts or LLM outputs, and vulnerabilities like indirect prompt injection.
- 1.5 Shared Responsibility: Data privacy in RAG is a shared responsibility between the organisation and the LLM provider. Organisations must implement client-side protections, and leverage provider controls.
- 1.6 Mitigation strategies: Key strategies include data minimisation, anonymisation, secure API key management, utilising provider controls like ZDR, considering architectural choixes like Azure OpenAI and securing LLM-generated code execution.
