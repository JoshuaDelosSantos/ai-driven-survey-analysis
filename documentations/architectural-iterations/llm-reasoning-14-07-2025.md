# LLM-Driven Reasoning Architecture Plan (Revised)
**Date:** 14 July 2025 (Revision 1.1)  
**Focus:** Statistical Reasoning Framework with Quality Validation  
**Approach:** Production-ready enterprise architecture with rigorous validation  
**Governance:** Australian Privacy Principles (APP) compliant with advanced privacy assessment

---

## Executive Summary

This plan implements a **statistical reasoning framework** for query understanding that addresses the fundamental challenge of handling query variance in analytical systems. By combining LLM reasoning with statistical validation, privacy assessment, and quality assurance, we transform the system from reactive pattern matching to adaptive intelligent analysis.

### Problem Analysis

**Current Issue**: The system cannot handle the variance and complexity of real-world analytical queries. Vector search fails for thematic analysis, but the deeper problem is the lack of adaptive reasoning for diverse query patterns.

**Root Cause**: Static classification systems cannot reason about optimal strategies for complex, ambiguous, or evolving query patterns that require multi-step analytical approaches.

**Solution**: Statistical reasoning framework with LLM-driven query understanding, rigorous sampling methodology, comprehensive quality validation, and advanced privacy protection.

## Architectural Foundation Analysis

### Current System Strengths
Based on codebase analysis, the existing architecture provides excellent foundations:

#### 1. Sophisticated Query Classification (`src/rag/core/routing/`)
- **Multi-stage pipeline**: Rule-based pre-filtering → LLM classification → fallback mechanisms
- **Australian PII protection**: Mandatory anonymisation throughout classification process
- **Modular design**: `QueryClassifier`, `PatternMatcher`, `LLMClassifier`, `ConfidenceCalibrator`
- **Robust error handling**: Circuit breaker patterns with graceful degradation

#### 2. Production-Ready Text-to-SQL Engine (`src/rag/core/text_to_sql/`)
- **AsyncSQLTool**: LangChain-integrated SQL generation with safety validation
- **Schema-only processing**: No personal data transmitted to LLMs
- **Query validation**: Auto-correction with `QueryLogicValidator`
- **Phase 2 enhancement**: Feedback table classification preventing incorrect joins

#### 3. Advanced Vector Search System (`src/rag/core/vector_search/`)
- **Privacy-compliant tool**: Automatic query anonymisation with rich metadata filtering
- **Multi-provider support**: OpenAI and Sentence Transformers with async batch processing
- **Sophisticated filtering**: User level, agency, sentiment scores, course delivery type
- **Performance monitoring**: Built-in metrics and audit logging

#### 4. Comprehensive Data Infrastructure
- **Rich metadata schema**: `rag_embeddings` table with JSONB metadata for complex filtering
- **Content diversity**: Evaluation table with structured ratings and free-text fields
- **Privacy controls**: Read-only database access with mandatory PII detection
- **Audit framework**: Complete logging with privacy-safe operation tracking

## Statistical Reasoning Architecture

### Core Philosophy: Adaptive Query Understanding with Validation

Instead of "What type of query is this?", the system asks "How should I approach this unique query with statistical rigor and quality assurance?"

### 1. Enhanced LLM Query Analyser with Domain Validation

**Location**: `src/rag/core/intelligence/enhanced_llm_query_analyser.py`

```python
class EnhancedLLMQueryAnalyser:

        """
        Multi-stage query analysis with feasibility and statistical validation.
        """
        # Stage 1: LLM intent analysis
        raw_analysis = await self._llm_analyse_intent(query)
        
        # Stage 2: Domain knowledge validation
        domain_validation = await self._validate_against_domain_constraints(raw_analysis)
        
        # Stage 3: Data availability assessment

        )
        
        # Stratification strategy with feasibility check
        stratification = self._design_stratification(
            population_stats.demographic_distribution,
            sample_requirements.total_sample_size
        )
        
        feasibility = self._assess_sampling_feasibility(stratification, population_stats)
