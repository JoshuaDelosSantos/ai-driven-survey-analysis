# LLM-Driven Tool Selection Architecture Plan
**Date:** 14 July 2025  
**Focus:** Enhanced Query Understanding & Tool Orchestration  
**Approach:** Minimal codebase changes, maximum intelligence gain  
**Governance:** Australian Privacy Principles (APP) compliant

---

## Executive Summary

This plan implements **LLM-driven tool selection** to replace the current rule-based query classification system, addressing the fundamental issue where vector search fails for thematic analysis queries. By leveraging the LLM's natural language understanding capabilities, we transform the system from reactive pattern matching to proactive query comprehension.

### Problem Analysis

**Current Issue**: Vector search returns zero results for thematic analysis queries like "What are the main themes in user feedback about virtual learning delivery?" because similarity-based retrieval cannot identify common patterns across diverse feedback texts.

**Root Cause**: Rule-based classification lacks semantic understanding of query intent, routing analytical questions to inappropriate tools.

**Solution**: LLM-driven query understanding with intelligent tool selection and content-aware data retrieval strategies.

---

## Architectural Foundation Analysis

### Current System Strengths
Based on codebase analysis, the existing architecture provides excellent foundations:

#### 1. Sophisticated Query Classification (`src/rag/core/routing/`)
- **Multi-stage pipeline**: Rule-based pre-filtering → LLM classification → fallback mechanisms
- **Australian PII protection**: Mandatory anonymisation throughout classification process
- **Modular design**: `QueryClassifier`, `PatternMatcher`, `LLMClassifier`, `ConfidenceCalibrator`
- **Robust error handling**: Circuit breaker patterns with graceful degradation

#### 2. Production-Ready Text-to-SQL Engine (`src/rag/core/text_to_sql/`)
- **AsyncSQLTool**: LangChain-integrated SQL generation with safety validation
- **Schema-only processing**: No personal data transmitted to LLMs
- **Query validation**: Auto-correction with `QueryLogicValidator`
- **Phase 2 enhancement**: Feedback table classification preventing incorrect joins

#### 3. Advanced Vector Search System (`src/rag/core/vector_search/`)
- **Privacy-compliant tool**: Automatic query anonymisation with rich metadata filtering
- **Multi-provider support**: OpenAI and Sentence Transformers with async batch processing
- **Sophisticated filtering**: User level, agency, sentiment scores, course delivery type
- **Performance monitoring**: Built-in metrics and audit logging

#### 4. Comprehensive Data Infrastructure
- **Rich metadata schema**: `rag_embeddings` table with JSONB metadata for complex filtering
- **Content diversity**: Evaluation table with structured ratings and free-text fields
- **Privacy controls**: Read-only database access with mandatory PII detection
- **Audit framework**: Complete logging with privacy-safe operation tracking

## LLM-Driven Architecture Enhancement

### Core Philosophy: Query Understanding Over Pattern Matching

Instead of "What type of query is this?", the system will ask "What does the user want to achieve, and how can I best help them?"

### 1. LLM Query Analyser (New Component)

**Location**: `src/rag/core/intelligence/llm_query_analyser.py`

```python
class LLMQueryAnalyser:
    """
    LLM-powered query understanding and tool orchestration.
    
    Replaces rule-based classification with intelligent query analysis
    that understands user intent and selects optimal data retrieval strategies.
    """
    
    async def analyse_query_intent(self, query: str) -> QueryAnalysis:
        """
        Analyse user query for intent, scope, and optimal tool selection.
        
        Returns:
            QueryAnalysis containing:
            - Primary intent (statistical, thematic, comparative, etc.)
            - Data requirements (structured data, feedback content, both)
            - Optimal tools (sql_tool, content_filter_tool, synthesis_tool)
            - Confidence reasoning
        """
    
    async def design_retrieval_strategy(self, analysis: QueryAnalysis) -> RetrievalStrategy:
        """
        Design optimal data retrieval approach based on query analysis.
        
        For thematic analysis:
        - Use content filtering instead of similarity search
        - Apply intelligent sampling for representative coverage
        - Extract patterns using LLM analysis of filtered content
        """
```

**Key Prompting Strategy**:
```
You are an expert data analyst specialising in Australian Public Service learning analytics. 

QUERY: "{user_query}"

AVAILABLE TOOLS & CAPABILITIES:
1. SQL Analysis: Statistical summaries, aggregations, demographic breakdowns
   - Tables: users, learning_content, attendance, evaluation
   - Rich structured data about completion rates, satisfaction scores, delivery types

2. Content Filtering: Intelligent sampling of feedback text with metadata filtering
   - 50,000+ feedback entries with user context (level, agency) and sentiment scores
   - Can filter by sentiment, user demographics, course characteristics
   - Ideal for thematic analysis and pattern discovery

3. LLM Synthesis: Pattern recognition and insight generation from filtered content
   - Analyses filtered feedback to identify themes, trends, issues
   - Provides evidence-based insights with representative examples

TASK: Analyse the query intent and recommend the optimal approach:

Intent Analysis:
- What is the user fundamentally trying to understand?
- Do they need statistical summaries or qualitative insights?
- Are they looking for patterns, trends, or specific information?

Tool Selection Logic:
- STATISTICAL queries → SQL Analysis
- THEMATIC queries → Content Filtering + LLM Synthesis  
- COMPARATIVE queries → SQL Analysis + Content Filtering + LLM Synthesis
- SPECIFIC queries → Content Filtering (targeted)

Return your analysis as JSON:
{
  "intent": "thematic_analysis|statistical_summary|comparative_analysis|specific_inquiry",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Explanation of intent analysis",
  "recommended_tools": ["content_filter_tool", "llm_synthesis_tool"],
  "data_strategy": "Filter feedback by virtual delivery type, apply sentiment analysis, identify recurring themes",
  "expected_approach": "Representative sampling → Pattern identification → Evidence synthesis"
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Content Filter Tool (Enhanced)

**Location**: `src/rag/core/tools/content_filter_tool.py`

```python
class ContentFilterTool(BaseTool):
    """
    Intelligent content filtering for thematic analysis and pattern discovery.
    
    Uses metadata-rich filtering instead of similarity search for analytical queries.
    Provides representative sampling with demographic and sentiment distribution.
    """
    
    async def filter_content(
        self,
        content_filters: Dict[str, Any],
        sampling_strategy: str = "representative",
        max_results: int = 100
    ) -> FilteredContent:
        """
        Filter evaluation content using intelligent sampling strategies.
        
        Sampling Strategies:
        - "representative": Ensures demographic and sentiment distribution
        - "targeted": Focused on specific criteria
        - "comprehensive": Broader coverage with quality filtering
        """
        
    async def get_thematic_sample(
        self,
        topic_keywords: List[str],
        user_levels: Optional[List[str]] = None,
        agencies: Optional[List[str]] = None,
        sentiment_filter: Optional[Dict] = None
    ) -> ThematicSample:
        """
        Intelligent sampling for thematic analysis with demographic representation.
        """
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Leverage existing infrastructure**: Uses `EmbeddingsManager.search_similar_with_metadata()` 
- **Smart sampling**: Ensures representative coverage across user levels and agencies
- **Quality filtering**: Prioritises substantive feedback over brief responses
- **Privacy compliance**: Uses existing PII detection and anonymisation

### 3. LLM Synthesis Tool (New)

**Location**: `src/rag/core/tools/llm_synthesis_tool.py`

```python
class LLMSynthesisTool(BaseTool):
    """
    LLM-powered analysis and synthesis of filtered content.
    
    Identifies themes, patterns, and insights from representative feedback samples.
    Provides evidence-based analysis with source attribution.

        Identify recurring themes and patterns in feedback content.
        
        Returns structured analysis with:
        - Key themes with frequency and sentiment
        - Representative quotes and evidence
        - Demographic insights (which user groups mention what)
        - Actionable recommendations
        """
    
    async def comparative_analysis(
        self,
        content_groups: Dict[str, List[Dict]],
        comparison_dimension: str
    ) -> ComparativeInsight:
        """
        Compare themes and patterns across different groups.
        
        E.g., Virtual vs In-person delivery feedback analysis
        """
```

class QueryClassifier:
    async def classify_with_llm_analysis(self, query: str) -> ClassificationResult:
        """Enhanced classification using LLM query understanding."""
        
        # Step 1: LLM analysis for intent understanding
        analysis = await self._llm_analyser.analyse_query_intent(query)
        
        # Step 2: Map intent to appropriate tools
        if analysis.intent == "thematic_analysis":
            return ClassificationResult(
                classification="CONTENT_ANALYSIS",
                confidence="HIGH",
                reasoning=f"LLM Analysis: {analysis.reasoning}",
                recommended_strategy=analysis.data_strategy
            )
        elif analysis.intent == "statistical_summary":
            return ClassificationResult(
                classification="SQL",

async def get_thematic_content(
    self,
    topic_context: str,
    demographic_filters: Dict[str, Any] = None
) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Get representative content sample for thematic analysis.
    Uses existing metadata filtering with intelligent sampling.
    """
    
    # Use existing search_similar_with_metadata with strategic filtering
    base_filters = {
        "field_name": ["general_feedback", "did_experience_issue_detail"],
        **demographic_filters
    }
    
    # Apply intelligent sampling to ensure representation

        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to existing vector search
        return await self._vector_search_node(state)
```

---

## Data Strategy Enhancement

### Intelligent Content Sampling

**Current Problem**: Vector search using cosine similarity cannot identify thematic patterns across semantically diverse feedback.

**Enhanced Approach**: Metadata-driven intelligent sampling with LLM pattern recognition.

#### Sampling Strategies by Query Type

##### 1. Thematic Analysis Queries
*"What are the main themes in user feedback about virtual learning?"*

**Strategy**: Representative demographic sampling with content quality filtering
```python
sampling_config = {
    "field_names": ["general_feedback", "did_experience_issue_detail"],
    "delivery_type_filter": ["Virtual"],
    "demographic_distribution": {
        "user_levels": ["Level 4", "Level 5", "Level 6", "Exec Level 1"],
        "agencies": "diverse_sample"  # Ensure multiple agencies
    },
    "content_quality": {
        "min_length": 20,  # Substantive feedback
        "exclude_generic": True
    },
    "sample_size": 50  # Representative but manageable
}
```

##### 2. Sentiment-Focused Analysis  
*"What negative feedback do senior staff have about course delivery?"*

**Strategy**: Sentiment-based filtering with hierarchy targeting
```python
sampling_config = {
    "sentiment_filter": {"negative": {"min_score": 0.6}},
    "user_level_filter": ["Level 5", "Level 6", "Exec Level 1", "Exec Level 2"],
    "field_names": ["general_feedback", "did_experience_issue_detail"],
    "sample_distribution": "sentiment_stratified"
}
```

##### 3. Comparative Analysis
*"How does feedback differ between virtual and in-person delivery?"*

**Strategy**: Stratified sampling with balanced group representation
```python
sampling_config = {
    "comparison_groups": {
        "virtual": {"course_delivery_type": "Virtual"},
        "in_person": {"course_delivery_type": "In-person"}
    },
    "sample_per_group": 30,
    "ensure_demographic_balance": True
}
```

### LLM Thematic Analysis Prompting

```python
THEMATIC_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert learning analytics researcher analysing Australian Public Service training feedback.

FEEDBACK SAMPLE: {content_sample}
ANALYSIS FOCUS: {query_focus}
USER CONTEXT: {demographic_info}

Identify the key themes in this feedback with the following structure:

THEMES IDENTIFIED:
1. [Theme Name] (Frequency: X/Y responses)
   - Key characteristics: [Description]
   - Representative quote: "[Anonymised quote]"
   - User groups mentioning: [Demographics]
   - Sentiment: [Positive/Negative/Mixed]

2. [Continue for all major themes...]

INSIGHTS:
- Most significant concerns: [Priority issues]
- Positive patterns: [What's working well]
- Demographic variations: [Differences by user level/agency]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Immediate actions: [Actionable improvements]
- Systemic improvements: [Longer-term enhancements]

Ensure all analysis is:
- Evidence-based with specific examples
- Demographically aware (APS levels and contexts)
- Actionable for learning designers
- Privacy-compliant (no personal identifiers)
"""
```

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Database Utilisation

**Leverage Existing Rich Metadata** (`data-dictionary.json` analysis):

#### Evaluation Table Capabilities
- **Structured feedback**: `facilitator_skills`, `guest_contribution`, `course_application`
- **Free-text analysis**: `did_experience_issue_detail`, `course_application_other`, `general_feedback`
- **Contextual metadata**: `course_delivery_type`, `agency`, `knowledge_level_prior`
- **Satisfaction metrics**: `positive_learning_experience`, `effective_use_of_time`, `relevant_to_work`

#### Smart Filtering Strategies
```python
# Example: Virtual learning effectiveness analysis
filtering_strategy = {
    "course_delivery_type": "Virtual",
    "field_names": ["general_feedback", "did_experience_issue_detail"],
    "satisfaction_threshold": {"effective_use_of_time": ">=3"},
    "demographic_balance": {
        "user_levels": ["Level 4", "Level 5", "Level 6"],
        "max_per_agency": 5  # Prevent single agency dominance
    }
}
```

### 2. Privacy-Compliant Implementation

**Leverage Existing PII Framework** (`data-governance.md` analysis):

#### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Input sanitisation**: Use existing `AustralianPIIDetector` for query anonymisation
2. **Content processing**: Apply existing anonymisation to filtered feedback
3. **Output validation**: Ensure synthesis results contain no personal identifiers
4. **Audit compliance**: Integrate with existing logging framework

#### Implementation Pattern
```python
class ContentFilterTool:
    async def filter_content(self, filters: Dict) -> FilteredContent:
        # Step 1: Apply existing privacy controls
        anonymised_filters = await self._pii_detector.anonymise_filters(filters)
        
        # Step 2: Use existing metadata search capabilities
        raw_content = await self._embeddings_manager.search_similar_with_metadata(
            metadata_filters=anonymised_filters,
            similarity_threshold=0.0,  # Use as filter, not similarity search
            limit=self._calculate_sample_size(filters)
        )
        
        # Step 3: Apply intelligent sampling
        representative_sample = self._ensure_representative_distribution(raw_content)
        
        # Step 4: Anonymise content before LLM analysis
        anonymised_content = await self._anonymise_content_batch(representative_sample)
        
        return FilteredContent(
            samples=anonymised_content,
            demographic_distribution=self._get_distribution_stats(raw_content),
            privacy_controls_applied=["pii_detection", "content_anonymisation"]
        )
```

### 3. Performance Optimisation

**Build on Existing Infrastructure** (`architectureV2.md` benchmarks):

#### Response Time Targets
- **Query analysis**: < 2 seconds (LLM classification existing benchmark)
- **Content filtering**: < 3 seconds (leverage existing `search_similar_with_metadata`)
- **Thematic synthesis**: < 5 seconds (LLM analysis of 50 representative samples)
- **End-to-end thematic analysis**: < 10 seconds total

#### Caching Strategy
```python
# Leverage existing circuit breaker and caching patterns
class LLMQueryAnalyser:
    @cached_llm_response(ttl=3600)  # Cache common query types
    async def analyse_query_intent(self, query: str) -> QueryAnalysis:
        # Implementation using existing LLM infrastructure
        pass
```

---

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### 1. Agent Enhancement Strategy

**Minimal Changes to Existing Workflows**:

```python
# Current routing logic (preserved)
def _route_after_classification(self, state: AgentState) -> str:
    classification = state.get("classification")
    
    # Existing routes (unchanged)
    if classification == "SQL":
        return "sql"
    elif classification == "VECTOR":
        return "vector"
    elif classification == "HYBRID":
        return "hybrid"
    
    # New routes (added)
    elif classification == "CONTENT_ANALYSIS":
        return "content_analysis"  # New thematic analysis path
    elif classification == "COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS":
        return "comparative_analysis"  # New comparative path
    
    # Fallback preserved
    else:
        return "sql"
```

### 2. Backward Compatibility

**Preserve All Existing Functionality**:
- SQL queries continue to use existing `AsyncSQLTool`
- Vector search queries use existing `VectorSearchTool`
- Hybrid queries use existing synthesis approach
- All privacy controls and audit logging preserved

### 3. Configuration Integration

**Extend Existing Settings** (`src/rag/config/settings.py`):

```python
class RAGSettings:
    # Existing settings preserved...
    
    # New LLM-driven tool selection settings
    enable_llm_query_analysis: bool = True
    llm_analysis_timeout: float = 5.0
    content_sample_size: int = 50
    theme_analysis_confidence_threshold: float = 0.7
    
    # Content filtering settings
    representative_sampling: bool = True
    demographic_balance_required: bool = True
    content_quality_filtering: bool = True
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Query Type Validation

**Test Cases for Enhanced Understanding**:

```python
test_queries = [
    # Thematic analysis (should route to content analysis)
    ("What are the main themes in user feedback about virtual learning?", "CONTENT_ANALYSIS"),
    ("What issues do participants mention about course delivery?", "CONTENT_ANALYSIS"),
    ("What do senior staff say about training effectiveness?", "CONTENT_ANALYSIS"),
    
    # Statistical analysis (should route to SQL)
    ("How many users completed virtual courses?", "SQL"),
    ("What's the average satisfaction score by agency?", "SQL"),
    ("Show completion rates by user level", "SQL"),
    
    # Comparative analysis (should route to hybrid)
    ("Compare satisfaction between virtual and in-person delivery", "COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS"),
    ("How does feedback differ across user levels?", "COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS"),
]

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_enhanced_query_routing():
    analyser = LLMQueryAnalyser()
    
    for query, expected_classification in test_queries:
        analysis = await analyser.analyse_query_intent(query)
        assert analysis.recommended_classification == expected_classification
```

### 2. Content Quality Validation

**Ensure Representative Sampling**:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio 
async def test_thematic_content_quality():
    """Test that thematic analysis produces meaningful, diverse results."""
    
    tool = ContentFilterTool()
    
    # Test virtual learning theme extraction
    filtered_content = await tool.filter_content({
        "course_delivery_type": "Virtual",
        "field_names": ["general_feedback"]
    })
    
    # Verify demographic diversity
    agencies = {sample["metadata"]["agency"] for sample in filtered_content.samples}
    assert len(agencies) >= 3  # Multiple agencies represented
    
    # Verify content quality
    avg_length = sum(len(s["chunk_text"]) for s in filtered_content.samples) / len(filtered_content.samples)
    assert avg_length >= 20  # Substantive feedback, not brief responses
    
    # Test thematic synthesis
    synthesis_tool = LLMSynthesisTool()
    themes = await synthesis_tool.identify_themes(
        content_sample=filtered_content.samples,
        analysis_focus="virtual learning delivery"
    )
    
    # Verify meaningful theme identification
    assert len(themes.primary_themes) >= 2
    assert all(theme.evidence_count >= 2 for theme in themes.primary_themes)
```

### 3. Privacy Compliance Testing

**Validate PII Protection Throughout Pipeline**:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_privacy_compliance_content_analysis():
    """Ensure no PII leakage in content analysis pipeline."""
    
    # Test query anonymisation
    original_query = "What did John Smith say about the training?"
    analyser = LLMQueryAnalyser()
    analysis = await analyser.analyse_query_intent(original_query)
    
    # Verify query was anonymised before LLM processing
    assert "John Smith" not in analysis.processed_query
    
    # Test content anonymisation
    content_tool = ContentFilterTool()
    filtered_content = await content_tool.filter_content({"field_name": "general_feedback"})
    
    # Verify no PII in filtered content
    pii_detector = AustralianPIIDetector()
    for sample in filtered_content.samples:
        pii_result = await pii_detector.detect_and_anonymise(sample["chunk_text"])
        assert not pii_result.pii_detected
```
