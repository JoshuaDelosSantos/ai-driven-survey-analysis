# AI-Enhanced Data Analysis

## 1. Overview
This project implements a privacy-compliant, AI-powered analysis system using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology to analyse Australian Public Service learning evaluations and attendance data with robust governance frameworks.

**Status**: Phase 3 Complete - Production-ready hybrid RAG system with user feedback analytics, privacy-first design, and comprehensive Australian data governance compliance.

## 2. Problem Statement
- We collect a variety of data (course information, user profiles, attendance, completions, and course evaluation from surveys), but most of our qualitative insights are buried in multiple Excel files.
- Manually reading and coding hundreds or thousands of free-text responses is time-consuming, error-prone, and prone to human bias.
- Without semantic context, business users may overlook patterns or misinterpret feedback.
